    addition ideas

        introduce some transitions for the toolti
        create a brushing effect that adjusts the view
        make button that will remove bar based on click to get more refined graph
        append the svg to a div that can be cssed around instead of the actual body
        change the bar order such that the one that is taller is always in the background so that I can access all bars with mouse

    issues that I'm stuck on
        I can't figure out how to make the brush adjusted scale actually change the content that is shown in focus
            furthermore, brush jumps to an unselected region, and cannot be moved.
        
        completed items
        x I went ahead and created a nice div element that has the person, word and count in a box that shows just to the right of the bar in question
        xx make highligting bar and axis hover for mouse
        xx center the heading p element
        xx make a pretty bar that will display the number of the hovered rectangle
        x highlighting bar all taken care of
            o stuck on the part whereby the text in the axis region lights up gold too.
                x finished this by taking using the index orders for each and instead of "this" using d3.select(this)
        x trouble with the bottom row of bars not being exactly the same 
                   x totally done, problem was with the rounding tilda's that I used in front




        xx delete the akis that is right next to the actual bars
        xx get the max scale set such that the 223 is actually the tallest bar
        xx make the bars have a linear increase, instead of having a huge chunk for 1 time appearing and then smaller pieces all the way up.
